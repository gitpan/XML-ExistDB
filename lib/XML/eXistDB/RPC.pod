=head1 NAME

XML::eXistDB::RPC - access eXist databases via RPC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a full implementation of the fXML-RPC interface to the
eXist Database. This is not just an one-on-one implementation: some
methods are smarter and many methods are renamed to correct historical
mistakes. Hopefully, the result is more readible.

B<warning:> some methods are tested lightly, but a lot is B<not tested>
in real-life. I have a long list of bugs for eXist 1.4, and hope that
they will get fixed in a next release. Please do not be disappointed:
contribute tests and fixes!

B<warning:> be careful when upgrading to release until C<0.90>, because
they may change method behavior and naming, See ChangeLog!

=head2 Perl interface

The methods in this module provide access to all facilities the XML-RPC
protocol interface offers. However, some of these calls are on a lower
level than practical in a programmers interface. A few larger wrapper
methods were created, most importantly L<uploadDocument()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Upload documents"> and
L<downloadDocument()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Download documents">.

Some defaults can be set at initiation (L<new()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Constructors">), such that repetition
can be avoided.

=head2 Definitions

The whole database (I<Repository>) contains sub-databases (I<Collections>),
which can have sub-collections themselves. Any collection contains
I<Documents> (indexable XML) and I<Binaries> (raw data). When both documents
and binaries are accepted, we speak about a I<Resource>.

=head2 Naming convensions

The XML-RPC method names are a mess: an typical example of many years
of growth. To repair that, consistent naming convensions are introduced.

Any method C<describeXXX()> collects a HASH with details about C<XXX>.
And any C<listXXX()> collects a list of C<XXX> names.  The typical Java
C<get> prefixes on some methods were removed in favor of better named
alternatives: sometimes C<list>, sometimes C<describe>, often something
completely different. Class attribute getters and setters naming should
not be used in interfaces (and are very not-Perl).

Most methods already had the form "<action><class>" (like "removeCollection"),
but on some random spots, the "class" was not present in the name.  This
has been repaired, which lowers the need to read the explanation of the
methods to understand what they are doing.

=head2 Return codes

RPC is a network protocol. Just like operating system calls: you shall
always check the return status of each call! Of course, this module could
simply ignore the existence of fault conditions, to provide a much simpler
programmers interface. But keep in mind: handling error conditions is
very important on the long run. A burdon for the first small programs,
but a desperate need for maintainability.

All methods return a LIST, where the first scalar is a return code (RC).
When that code is C<0>, all went well.  Otherwise, the code represent the
transport error or the exception (refusal) as reported by the server
logic.  In either case, the second scalar in the returned list contains
the error message.  For instance,

  my $user = guest;
  my ($rc, $details) = $db->describeUser($user);
  $rc==0
      or die "cannot get user info for `$user': $details ($rc)\n";

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item XML::eXistDB::RPC-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

You must either specify your own L<XML::Compile::RPC::Client> object
with the C<rpc> option, or a C<destination> which will be used to create
such object.

 -Option            --Default
  chunk_size          32
  compress_upload     128
  destination         <undef>
  format              []
  password            'guest'
  prettyprint_upload  <false>
  repository          '/db'
  rpc                 <undef>
  schemas             <created>
  user                'guest'

=over 2

=item chunk_size => KILOBYTES

Send or download data in chunks (fragments) of this size when the size
exceeds this quantity.  If C<0>, then chunking is disabled.

=item compress_upload => KILOBYTES

Compress the upload of resources when their size is over this number of
KILOBYTES in size. This will cost performance mainly on the client.

=item destination => URI

Where the RPC server is (the ExistDB access point)

=item format => ARRAY|HASH

The default for "options" which can be passed with many methods.

=item password => STRING

=item prettyprint_upload => BOOLEAN

=item repository => STRING

The repository; the top-level collection.

=item rpc => OBJECT

=item schemas => OBJECT

When you need to do complex things with the eXist schema's, you
may prepare an L<XML::eXistDB|XML::eXistDB> object beforehand. However, that
shouldn't be needed under normal cicumstances. By default, such
object is created for you.

=item user => USERNAME

Used as default when a username is required. For now, that is only used
by L<lockResource()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Resources">.

=back

=back

=head2 Helpers

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<schemas>()

Returns the L<XML::eXistDB|XML::eXistDB> object which contains all eXistDB specific
schema information. At first call, the object will get created for you.
Once created, you'll always get the same.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<trace>()

Returns the trace information from the last command executed over RPC. Nearly
all methods in this class only perform one RPC call. You can find the timings,
http request, and http response in the returned HASH.

=back

=head3 Format

A number of methods support formatting options, to control the output.
With the method call, these parameters can be passed as list with pairs.

 indent:  returns indented pretty-print XML.         yes|no
 encoding: character encoding used for the output.   <string>
 omit-xml-declaration: XML declaration to the head.  yes|no
 expand-xincludes: expand XInclude elements.         yes|no
 process-xsl-pi: apply stylesheet to the output.     yes|no
 highlight-matches: show result from fulltext search.elements|attributes|both
 stylesheet: to apply. rel-path from database        <path>
 stylesheet-params: stylesheet params                <HASH>

The use of the "stylesheet-params" is simplified compared to the official
XML-RPC description, with a nested HASH.

=head3 Sending XML

Some method accept a DOCUMENT which can be a XML::LibXML::Document
node, a string containing XML, a SCALAR (ref-string) with the same, or
a filename.

=head2 Repository

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<backup>($user, $password, $tocoll, $fromcoll)

=item $obj-E<gt>B<configureCollection>($collection, $configuration, %options)

The $configuration is a whole C<.xconfig>, describing the collection.
This can be a XML::LibXML::Document node, a stringified XML
document, or a HASH.

When the $configuration is a HASH, the data will get formatted
by L<XML::eXistDB::createCollectionConfig()|XML::eXistDB/"Collection configuration (.xconf)">.

  my %trigger1 = (parameter => [ {name => 'p1', value => '42'} ];
  my @triggers = (\%trigger1, \%trigger2);

  my %config   =

Please use L<uploadDocument()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Upload documents">.
Put the content of document which was just oploaded with L<upload()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: uploading documents"> to
the server under some $tempname (received from L<upload()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: uploading documents">) as $resource
in the database. Like L<parseLocal()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: uploading documents">, but with extra C<$isxml> boolean,
to indicate that the object is XML, where the server does not know that
from the mime-type.

NB: B<Local> means "server local", which is remote for us as clients.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<storeBinary>( $bytes, $resource, $mime, $replace, [$created, $modified] )

Please use L<uploadBinary()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Upload documents">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<upload>( [$tempname], $chunk )

Please use L<uploadDocument()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Upload documents">.
Upload a document in parts to the server. The first upload will give
you the TEMPoraryNAME for the object. You may leave that name out or
explicitly state C<undef> at that first call.  When all data is uploaded,
call L<parseLocal()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: uploading documents"> or L<parseLocalExt()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: uploading documents">.

example: 

   # start uploading
   my ($rc1, $tmp)  = $db->upload(undef, substr($data, 0, 999));
   my ($rc1, $tmp)  = $db->upload(substr($data, 0, 999));  # same

   # send more chunks
   my ($rc2, undef) = $db->upload($tmp,  substr($data, 1000));

   # insert the document in the database
   my ($rc3, $ok)   = $db->parseLocal($tmp, '/db/file.xml', 0, 'text/xml')
      if $rc1==0 && $rc2==0;

=item $obj-E<gt>B<uploadCompressed>( [$tempname], $chunk )

Please use L<uploadDocument()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Upload documents">.
Like L<upload()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: uploading documents">, although the chunks are part of a compressed file.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<retrieveFirstChunk>( <($doc, $nodeid) | ($resultset, $pos)>, [$format] )

Please use L<retrieveDocumentNode()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Simple node queries"> or L<retrieveResult()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Query returns result as set">.
Two very different uses for this method: either retrieve the first part
of a single node from a document, or retrieve the first part of an
answer in a result set.  See L<getNextChunk()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Please avoid: download documents"> for the next chunks.

=head3 Please avoid: collect query results

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<getDocumentChunked>($docname, %options)

Please use L<downloadDocument()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Download documents">

example: 

   my ($rc, $handle, $total_length) = $db->getDocumentChuncked($doc);
   my $xml = $db->getDocumentNextChunk($handle, 0, $total_length-1);

=item $obj-E<gt>B<getDocumentNextChunk>($handle, $start, $length)

=item $obj-E<gt>B<initiateBackup>($directory)

Trigger the backup task to write to the $directory. Returns true, always,
but that does not mean success: the initiation will succeed.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<isValidDocument>($document)

Returns true when the $document (inside the database) is validated as
correct.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<retrieve>( <($doc, $nodeid) | ($resultset, $pos)>, [$format] )

Please use L<retrieveResult()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Query returns result as set"> or L<retrieveDocumentNode()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Simple node queries">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<retrieveAll>( $resultset, [$format] )

Please use L<retrieveResults()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Query returns result as set">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<retrieveAllFirstChunk>( $resultset, [$format] )

Please use L<retrieveResults()|XML::eXistDB::RPC/"Query returns result as set">.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<retrieveAsString>($document, $nodeid, %options)

=head2 Renamed methods

Quite a number of API methods have been renamed to be more consistent
with other names.  Using the new names should improve readibility. The
original names are still available:

  -- xml-rpc name           -- replacement name
  createResourceId          => uniqueResourceName
  dataBackup                => initiateBackup
  getBinaryResource         => downloadBinary
  getCreationDate           => collectionCreationDate
  getDocumentListing        => listResources
  getGroups                 => listGroups
  getHits                   => numberOfResults
  getPermissions            => describeResourcePermissions
  getResourceCount          => countResources
  getTimestamps             => listResourceTimestamps
  getUser                   => describeUser
  getUsers                  => listUsers
  hasUserLock               => whoLockedResource
  isValid                   => isValidDocument
  listCollectionPermissions => describeCollectionPermissions
  printDiagnostics          => describeCompile
  queryP                    => queryXPath
  querySummary              => describeResultSet
  releaseQueryResult        => releaseResultSet
  remove                    => removeResource
  xupdate                   => xupdateCollection
  xupdateResource           => xupdateResource

=head1 SYNOPSYS

  my $db = XML::eXistDB::RPC->new(destination => $uri);
  my ($rc1, $h) = $db->describeUser('guest');
  $rc1==0 or die "Error: $h\n";

  my ($rc2, $set) = $db->executeQuery($query);
  my ($rc3, @answers) = $db->retrieveResults($set);
